# Setup

Run `npm install` in the top-level directory to install the depedencies.

## Server

Start the server from the top-level directory with `node server/index`.

## Client

1. Test a single name: run `node client/index` 

2. Test many names (both on, and not on the list), run `node client/testMany`.  It will output the number of tests, any failing results, and the final status (100% pass, or fail).
